# terraform_aws_automation
Assignment 2 for DevOps module on HDip in Computer Science at SETU

The core brief of this assignment is to use AWS load balancing, auto-scaling and other features to host a web application with appropriate security, load balancing and other relevant features.
This readme will be expanded as the project progresses. The assignment is fully completable in the aws console but I've elected to use terraform to automate the process thus ensuring consistency and version control.
